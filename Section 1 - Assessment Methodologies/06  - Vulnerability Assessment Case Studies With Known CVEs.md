# Heartbleed ([CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0160))

CVE-2014-0160, also known as Heartbleed, is a severe security vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic software library that was discovered in April 2014. The vulnerability allows attackers to access sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and other data that is supposed to be protected by SSL/TLS encryption.

The Heartbleed vulnerability affected many websites, services, and devices worldwide, including popular services like Yahoo, Google, and PayPal. It was considered one of the most significant security vulnerabilities of its time and led to widespread concern over the security of online communications.


The Heartbleed bug is caused by a flaw in the OpenSSL code that handles the heartbeat extension of the TLS/DTLS protocol. An attacker **can send a specially crafted heartbeat request to a vulnerable server, causing it to disclose a portion of its memory**. This could potentially include sensitive information like private keys, session cookies, and other data.

A patch for the vulnerability was quickly released, and affected organizations were advised to update their OpenSSL software and revoke and reissue their SSL/TLS certificates. It's essential to keep software and systems up to date to mitigate the risk of vulnerabilities like Heartbleed.

## Exploit it using Nmap
``` bash
nmap -p 443 --script ssl-heartbleed <target>
#Detects whether a server is vulnerable to the OpenSSL Heartbleed bug (CVE-2014-0160). The code is based on the Python script ssltest.py authored by Katie Stafford (katie@ktpanda.org)

nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 <host>
#This script repeatedly initiates SSLv3/TLS connections, each time trying a new cipher or compressor while recording whether a host accepts or rejects it. The end result is a list of all the ciphersuites and compressors that a server accepts.
```


# EternalBlue - MS17-010 (CVE-2017-0143)

CVE-2017-0143 is a security vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows operating system, specifically in the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This vulnerability, also known as EternalBlue, **allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by sending specially crafted requests to the SMB service. This vulnerability was famously exploited by the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017**, which caused widespread disruption and damage to organizations worldwide.

Microsoft released a patch for CVE-2017-0143 on March 14, 2017, before the WannaCry attack occurred. However, many organizations failed to apply the patch in a timely manner, leaving their systems vulnerable to the attack. In the aftermath of the WannaCry attack, Microsoft issued urgent alerts and advisories urging users to update their systems immediately to protect against the vulnerability.

It is worth noting that while **the initial exploit of CVE-2017-0143 was associated with the WannaCry ransomware attack**, the vulnerability itself is not specific to ransomware and could be used by attackers for a variety of malicious purposes. Therefore, it is still important for users to ensure that their systems are fully patched and up-to-date to protect against this vulnerability.

## Exploit it using Nmap

``` bash

nmap -p445 --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 <target>
  
nmap -p445 --script vuln <target>

#Attempts to detect if a Microsoft SMBv1 server is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability (ms17-010, a.k.a. EternalBlue). The vulnerability is actively exploited by WannaCry and Petya ransomware and other malware.
```

# Log4J ([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228))

CVE-2021-44228 is a security vulnerability in Apache Log4j, a widely used Java-based logging utility. This vulnerability, also known as Log4Shell, **allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server by sending specially crafted requests to the server that trigger the execution of malicious code.** This vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible severity rating.

The Log4Shell vulnerability was first disclosed in December 2021 and has since been the subject of widespread concern and remediation efforts across the tech industry. Many organizations have issued urgent alerts and advisories urging users to take immediate action to patch their systems and protect against potential attacks. If you are a user of Apache Log4j, it is highly recommended that you update to the latest version as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of exploitation.
