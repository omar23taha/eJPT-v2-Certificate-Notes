## Vulnerability Definition:
A weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

## [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/data_feeds.html):  

CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a list of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures. CVE IDs are assigned by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) like MITRE, to provide standardized names for vulnerabilities and security exposures.

### Some key points about CVE:

• CVE List is the central CVE database tracking vulnerabilities across multiple platforms and applications.

• CVE IDs include the year, CVE identifier number, and a description of the vulnerability. For e.g. CVE-2019-0752.

• Helps in reducing confusion and ambiguity in the industry to identify vulnerabilities and taking actions like patching.

• CVE does not determine the severity of vulnerabilities, it is left to the CNAs and CVE Compatible Products like NVD.

• Not all vulnerabilities are added to CVE immediately, it depends on public disclosure by vendors and researchers.

## Zero Day Vulnerability:  

A zero-day vulnerability refers to a flaw in software, hardware or system that is unknown to the organization or vendor. This means there is no patch or fix available for it yet.  

### Some characteristics of zero-day vulnerabilities:

• Can be extremely dangerous as there is no immediate solution to fix or mitigate them.  
• Mostly discovered and disclosed by security researchers and hackers. Vendors are not aware of them.  
• Can be extremely valuable if sold on the black market and used for cyber attacks like targeted malware campaigns.  
• Difficult to defend against as traditional security solutions don't have the signature or patterns to detect them.  
• Responsible disclosure of zero-days to vendors is important to develop fixes and patches. However, some researchers sell them for profit on the black market.

## [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/vulnerability-detail-pages):  
NIST stands for National Institute of Standards and Technology. It is a US federal agency under the Department of Commerce.

### Some of the major cybersecurity contributions of NIST are:

• **NIST** Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity: A very popular cybersecurity framework adopted by organizations. Includes Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover functions.

• **NVD** or National Vulnerability Database: The US government repository of standards based vulnerability management data. Includes database of CVE vulnerabilities along with severity scores.

• **SP** or Special Publications in cybersecurity. For e.g. SP 800-171 for protecting CUI in non-federal systems and organizations.

• **FIPS** or Federal Information Processing Standards. These are standards and guidelines for US government agencies like FIPS 199 for security categorization of federal information systems.

• Cryptographic standards and algorithms. For e.g. Advanced Encryption Standard or AES as FIPS 197.

• Cybersecurity practice guides and frameworks for small businesses and cyber supply chain risk management.

• Conducting research in encryption, blockchain, cybersecurity measurements, quantum computing and more.

• Organizing workshops and draft publications on privacy engineering, internet of things, artificial intelligence and more.

### How to find our vulnerabilities?
+ Scanning
+ Asset Identification + Research
+ Fuzz Testing (input/handling/validation) 

## Vulnerability Assessment

is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing security vulnerabilities in computer systems, applications, and network infrastructures. It provides an organization with the necessary information to understand its security posture and strengthen its defenses against potential attacks.

## Methodologies

There are several methodologies for conducting vulnerability assessments. Key methodologies include:

1.  **Automated Scanning**: Utilizing automated vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in systems and applications. These tools compare system configurations and installed software against databases of known vulnerabilities and report any matches.
    
2.  **Manual Testing**: Skilled penetration testers manually probe systems and applications for vulnerabilities. They simulate attacks, identify potential weaknesses, and suggest remediation actions. Manual testing often complements automated scanning, as it can uncover vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
    
3.  **Checklist-based Assessments**: Following a predefined checklist of security best practices, assessors evaluate systems and applications to ensure they adhere to industry standards and guidelines, such as NIST or CIS.
    
4.  **Risk-based Assessments**: Focusing on the organization's most critical assets, assessors prioritize vulnerabilities based on their potential impact on the organization's operations, reputation, or regulatory compliance.

5.  **Red Teaming**: Adversarial simulation of threats against an organization's security defenses. It helps evaluate the effectiveness of blue teams and identifies weaknesses. Uses techniques like social engineering, phishing as well as tools similar to penetration testing.
    
6.  **Risk Analysis:** Systematically analyzing the probability and impact of vulnerabilities to determine the level of risk. Qualitative or Quantitative risk analysis can be performed based on the criticality of the assets. Helps prioritize vulnerabilities and remediation efforts.
    
7.  **Code Review**: Manual review and analysis of application source code to identify insecure code, vulnerabilities and backdoors. Requires expert programmers and can be ttime-consumingbut uncovers issues that tools may miss.
    
4.  Compliance Audits: Assessing the organization's systems and practices against a set of compliance requirements like PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001 etc. Identifies gaps against the standard and provides remediation guidance. Uses interviews, document reviews, observations and tools like mentioned above.
