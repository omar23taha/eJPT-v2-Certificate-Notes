Villain is a C2 framework that can handle multiple TCP socket & HoaxShell-based reverse shells, enhance their functionality with additional features (commands, utilities etc) and share them among connected sibling servers (Villain instances running on different machines).

The framework's main features include:

-   Payload generation based on default, customizable and/or user defined payload templates (Windows & Linux),
-   A dynamically engaged pseudo-shell prompt that can quickly swift between shell sessions,
-   File uploads (via http),
-   Auto-http request & exec scripts against sessions (a bit unstable),
-   Auto-invoke ConPtyShell against a powershell r-shell session as a new process to gain a fully interactive Windows shell,
-   Team chat,
-   Session Defender (a feature that inspects user issued commands for mistakes / unintentional input that may cause a shell to hang)
