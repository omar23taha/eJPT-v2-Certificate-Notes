DevSecOps, or Development, Security and Operations, is the philosophy of integrating security practices into DevOps. It aims to integrate security testing and monitoring into the DevOps pipeline, and bringing development, security and operations teams together with a shared goal.

Some key principles of DevSecOps are:

• Security as Code: Define and deploy security controls as code, similar to infrastructure as code in DevOps. This helps embed security throughout the development lifecycle.

• Automation: Automate security scanning, testing and monitoring as much as possible. This includes automating tasks like dependency scanning, configuration compliance, vulnerability scanning etc.

• Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor for vulnerabilities, compliance issues, misconfigurations and threats across the development and production environments.

• Collaboration: Promote collaboration between Dev, Sec and Ops teams through transparency, shared goals and translation of requirements across teams.

• Shift Left: Move security testing and controls earlier in the development lifecycle, especially during coding and testing phases. This helps identify issues early and reduce risks.

• Continuous Integration and Delivery: Include security controls, testing and monitoring tools in the CI/CD pipeline. All code changes should be inspected for security issues during the pipeline before release.

• Infrastructure as Code: Define and provision infrastructure through code to enable consistent security configurations and faster deployments. IaC templates can be scanned for vulnerabilities and compliance.

• Risk Management: Take a risk-based approach to vulnerabilities, threats and security controls. Focus on critical risks and prioritize accordingly based on business impact. Continuously assess and manage cyber risk.

• Security Automation: Automate as many security tasks as possible through automated tools, scripts and playbooks. This reduces repetition, increases consistency and speeds up delivery.

Some popular tools used in DevSecOps are:

• Git for version control along with code scanning tools like Snyk, Veracode etc.

• Dependency scanning tools like OWASP Dependency Check, Retire.js etc.

• Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools like Checkmarx, Veracode, Fortify etc.

• Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, arachni etc.

• Container and cloud security scanning tools like Aqua, Twistlock, CloudSploit etc.

• Secrets management tools like Hashicorp Vault, Azure Key Vault etc.

• Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanners like Checkov, Terraform compliance, Cloud Custodian etc.

• CI/CD pipeline tools like Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI etc. integrated with security tools.

• Vulnerability management tools like Tenable.io, Rapid7 InsightVM, Qualys etc.

• Threat monitoring tools like VirusTotal, Threat Grid, AWS GuardDuty etc.
